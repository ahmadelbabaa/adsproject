# LinkedIn for Students

### This application is a platform that makes it easier for university students to find jobs or internships. Whether it's students at the end of their academic journey looking for entry level positions, or new students looking for an internship to improve their skills within the field. It would also serve as a platform for companies and employers who have job openings that are looking to hire.
