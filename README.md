# LinkedIn for Students

### This application is a platform that makes it easier for university students to find jobs or internships. Whether it's students at the end of their academic journey looking for entry level positions, or new students looking for an internship to improve their skills within the field. It would also serve as a platform for companies and employers who have job openings that are looking to hire.

This picture shows how the graph illustrates the links between the students and the companies. Students who posses interests and skills that are required by the company, are linked with that company.

The student and company names are from a random list generated by us manually just so we can test out the program. The actual application should include a much larger database of students and companies.
